# Icons

Icons are converted from [@navikt/ds-icons](https://github.com/navikt/aksel/tree/main/%40navikt/icons) and can be imported from `@nais/ds-svelte-community/icons`.

Check out the full list of icons at [Aksel ikoner](https://aksel.nav.no/ikoner).

```html
<script>
	import { StarIcon } from "@nais/ds-svelte-community/icons";
</script>

<StarIcon title="nav" />
```

## Optimizations and performance

Importing directly from `@nais/ds-svelte-community/icons` will result in a large bundle size. To reduce bundle size, you can import icons directly from `@nais/ds-svelte-community/icons/<icon>`.

You might also want to [use our preprocessor](/#preprocessor).

We will also be adding a preprocessor to optimize imports at a later date.
