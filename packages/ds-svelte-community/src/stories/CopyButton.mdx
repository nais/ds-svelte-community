# CopyButton

Allow users to copy text to clipboard.

**Note:**
This differs from the `@navikt/ds-react` implementation in that it uses the `navigator.clipboard` API instead of the `document.execCommand("copy")` API.
This is to simplify code and support up-to-date browsers only. If you support IE or older browsers, reach out.
