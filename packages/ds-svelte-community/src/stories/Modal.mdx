# Modal

Modals are useful tools when you have critical information a user needs to take a stance on.

**Note**: This component differs from the `@navikt/ds-react` component in that it uses the `dialog` element instead of custom markup.
This reduces the amount of properties available. If this doesn't work for you, reach out.

Read more about this component in the [Aksel documentation](https://aksel.nav.no/komponenter/core/modal).
