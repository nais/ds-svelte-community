# CSS

You should add the following import to your root `+layout.svelte` file:

```svelte
<script>
	import "@nais/ds-svelte-community/css";
</script>
```

This CSS extends [@navikt/ds-css](https://github.com/navikt/aksel/tree/main/%40navikt/core/css) and will style `a`s as `Link` components.

If you want unstyled `a`, you can add the class `unstyled` to prevent this styling.
