## Development

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) to manage dependencies and run scripts.

Run `asdf install` to install the correct version of `bun`. (You might need to run `asdf plugin add bun` first.)

The library is split into multiple packages in the `packages` directory. Each package has its own `README.md` with more information.
